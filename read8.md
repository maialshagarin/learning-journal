# How Computers Work
**years ago  the computers just made for basic calculation. but now we use them to talk to each other , play games, control reports and anything we can imagine.**
Computers are machines manipulate the informations and performs 4 tasks:
1. Input.
1. Storage.
1. Processe.
1. Output
**computer works on ones & zeros inside the computer there is a lot of wires and circuits that carry all the information in the computer using electricity by either on or off, yes or no, true or false and 1 or 0. alos with more wire (more bits) we will get more information.<br>**
so the method is :
Computers get the data from Input tools and convert it to binary data and store it to a memory using a storage tools after that computers use a center processing unit (CPU) to process the calculation, finaly the output tools works to convert the result into visical output andurstandable to the human.
